# PI-05 reviewer review — human-authorized bounce-3 recovery

- Verdict: **PASS** (96/100, diagnostic only)
- Ticket status: **Done**
- Tested commit: `40e6a2b5747f547b1c0e0b286a7cc3463044837f`
- Blocking findings: none
- Push: not requested; none performed

## Evidence

- `node --test --experimental-strip-types extensions/workflow/flow-panel.test.ts extensions/workflow/policy.test.ts && npm run check` → exit 0; 24 targeted tests passed; TypeScript clean.
- Independent production `FlowPanel.render` probe → exit 0. Synthetic cases covered balanced, malformed/unbalanced, semicolon-separated, quoted, folded space/tab continuation, adjacent sensitive headers, URLs, ANSI/control text, ordinary neighboring lines, and width bounds.
- `node --test --experimental-strip-types extensions/ui-customization/footer.test.ts` → exit 0; 21 tests passed, including three base lines plus at most four stage rows and width bounds.
- `npm run format:check` → exit 0.
- `git diff --check` → exit 0.
- `npm test` → exit 1; 165/167 Node tests passed. The only failures were the known live Claude monthly-spend-limit tests (`Claude backend completes a live manager run`, `Claude backend interrupt settles a live run as aborted`). The chained Vitest command did not run after the Node failure.

## Acceptance judgment

- Agents: planner → coder → debugger → reviewer order before helpers; shared measured/indeterminate readings.
- Overview: one plain route-reason sentence.
- Waiting: present for `needs-input`, `needs-helper`, and `blocked`; absent otherwise.
- Progress: no percent for indeterminate readings.
- Bounds: panel rows fit requested widths; footer base plus four stage rows remains at seven lines.
- Redaction: no synthetic secret marker survived the production render probe; ordinary neighboring lines remained visible.
- Purity: the render path contains no filesystem, network, or subprocess operation.

Routing: **Done** after explicitly authorized targeted recovery; no automatic fourth bounce.
