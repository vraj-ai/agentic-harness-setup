# Spec — persistent flow UI + local token savings + Windows portability

Date: 2026-08-04 · Stage: planner (plan) · Repo: `~/Work/pi-agent`

## Audit (evidence, gathered before planning)

| Claim | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Footer already carries a flow rail | `git log --oneline` → `baf5272 ui: move workflow rail into footer`; `extensions/ui-customization/index.ts` `setFooter` renders 3 lines (cwd/runtime, rail, usage/PR) |
| Per-agent detail is not in the footer | Footer shows only `route · status`; agent rows exist only in `FlowPanel.agents()` (`extensions/workflow/index.ts`) and as `N running · N tracked` in the header |
| Subagent summaries carry no stage identity | `WorkflowSubagentSummary` in `extensions/shared/workflow-state.ts` has `id/title/status/backend/modelLabel/contextTokens/contextWindow/turns` — no stage, no start time |
| Ponytail is installed but undocumented here | `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` → `"packages": ["git:github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail", ...]`; source at `~/.pi/agent/git/github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail` (v4.8.4, ships `pi-extension/` + 6 skills). `grep -ril ponytail` over this repo: no hits. `SYSTEM.md`/`README.md` never mention it. |
| Caveman is not wired into Pi | Exists only at `~/.claude/skills/caveman` (Claude Code). `ls ~/.pi/agent/skills` → `background-terminals`, `subagents` only |
| A third-party proxy already sees Anthropic traffic | `~/.pi/agent/models.json` → `anthropic.baseUrl = https://agentrouter.org` with an API key (runtime-only, git-ignored) |
| RTK/Caveman *proxy* compression = OmniRoute feature | `~/.hermes/node/lib/node_modules/omniroute/README.md` — "RTK + Caveman compression saves 15–95% tokens". Installed under `~/.hermes` only; not connected to Pi |
| "Headroom proxy" | No artifact found anywhere on disk (`grep -ril headroom` over `~/.pi`, `~/.claude/skills`, `~/Work/pi-agent` → no hits). Not assessable from local evidence; **out of scope** under the locked decision |
| Baseline gate is green | `npm run check` → tsc clean; `npm test` → 22 tests passed |
| No git remote, no matching GitHub Project | `git remote -v` → empty. `gh project list --owner @me` → X-Agent, Vraj-Website, WGS, Surf-Royale, Media-Agent, Lullabook — none for pi-agent |

**Tracker mode: local-file (`tickets.md`).** `gh` is authenticated with `project` scope, but this repo has no remote and no board. Tickets below are the tracker. Creating a remote is a user action, not mine (see Blocker).

## Locked decisions (from the user)

1. **Adaptive footer** — 3 base lines always; one row per tracked planner–reviewer agent, shown only while that agent exists; max 4 rows (7 lines total).
2. **Measured-only percent** — percentages come from exactly three in-process denominators: context tokens/window, question `k/N`, stage `k/4`. Everything else shows elapsed + turns and no number. *(Revised: an earlier answer allowed a tracker-derived tickets done/total percent; the user's final answer excludes it, so no tracker read is on the UI path at all. PI-03 is dropped.)*
3. **Local-only adoption; the proxy is investigate-only.** Ponytail, a Pi Caveman equivalent, and prompt-cache stability ship. A compressing proxy (OmniRoute RTK+Caveman, or Headroom if it can be located) is **evaluated and reported, never wired in** — adoption needs a fresh user decision. The whole workflow must also run on the user's Windows laptop.

## Invariants (testable; `/debugger` attacks these, `/reviewer` reviews them)

- **INV-1 no-false-progress.** No percentage is rendered unless the same reading carries the numerator *and* denominator it was computed from. Absent a denominator the UI shows glyph + elapsed + turns and no number that could be read as completion.
- **INV-2 no-secret.** No API key, token, cookie, auth header, provider base URL, or `.env` value ever reaches the footer, `/flow`, OS notifications, `tickets.md`, or a handoff. Task previews and agent titles are truncated and secret-pattern scrubbed before display.

  **INV-2 documented exception — PI-07 prompt assembly, opaque/rootless colon-delimited userinfo (human-authorized, 2026-08-04).** INV-2 itself is **unchanged and remains in force project-wide**. What is narrowed is the *guarantee a single ticket claims to enforce*: PI-07's system-prompt redaction covers named credential assignments, `Authorization`/`Cookie` headers (including folded continuations) and `Bearer`/`Basic` tokens, recognized secret token formats, hierarchical or slash-prefixed credential URIs (`scheme://user:pw@host`, `scheme:/…`, `jdbc:…:user/pw@host`) with all such URLs replaced by `[URL]`, and query-string credentials. It **does not** cover opaque/rootless URIs whose userinfo is colon-delimited with no `//` root and no `/` separator — canonically `sip:user:password@example.test`, plus comparable SIP/SIPS and colon-delimited JDBC userinfo variants.

  Rationale: `scheme:a:b@c` is syntactically indistinguishable from ordinary prose and structured text that legitimately appears in prompts; enforcing the absolute by pattern produced three non-converging review bounces (see `tickets.md` PI-07 bounce history and issue #9). This is recorded as a **known, accepted, documented residual risk against INV-2**, not as a silent gap: it is stated in issue #9, in `tickets.md`, in a source doc comment on `extensions/workflow/prompt-assembly.ts`, and in one explicitly named scope test. A fail-closed structured-boundary redesign that would close it must be filed as a **new ticket**; it is deliberately not attempted under PI-07.

  **Security warning (unchanged):** never paste raw `.env` files, credential URIs, or provider secrets into prompts, tickets, or handoffs. Redaction is defense in depth, not permission to handle secrets carelessly.
- **INV-3 render is pure and fast.** The footer render path performs no filesystem, network, or subprocess I/O and completes in **≤2 ms at width 200** (p95 over 1000 renders). All external reads happen off the render path.
- **INV-4 bounded footprint.** Footer ≤7 lines and ≤4 stage rows, every line truncated to the terminal width, never wrapped, at any width ≥20 columns.
- **INV-5 staleness is visible.** A reading older than **30 s** renders dimmed with a `~` prefix. Stale data is never presented as current.
- **INV-6 degrade, never fabricate, never crash.** A missing or malformed reading becomes indeterminate (not `0%`, not last-known-good past the staleness window). Any throw inside the footer renderer is caught and the base 3 lines still render.
- **INV-7 portability.** No macOS-only assumption on the shipped path. Notification and installer paths degrade to a logged no-op on an unsupported platform instead of throwing.
- **INV-8 no new trust edge without a decision.** No ticket in this plan changes provider routing, adds a prompt-carrying network hop, or sends any real prompt or credential to a third party. The proxy evaluation (PI-09) is a document-only spike: it may read public docs and run a local measurement with synthetic prompts and no credentials, and it ends in a recommendation, never in configuration.

### Latency / cadence budgets

| Path | Budget |
| --- | --- |
| Footer render | ≤2 ms @ width 200 |
| `/flow` open | ≤50 ms |
| Reading staleness threshold | 30 s |
| Subagent bridge timeout (existing) | 10 s |

### Failure modes

| Dependency | Down / slow / garbage | User sees |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subagent bridge | timeout (already 10 s) | stage row shows `×` + reason in `/flow`; footer stays bounded |
| Context usage unavailable | `getContextUsage()` returns nothing | context percent omitted; row falls back to elapsed + turns |
| OS notifier | absent (`notify-send`, BurntToast) | silent no-op; TUI + title remain authoritative |
| Extension throw | any | base 3 footer lines render; error surfaced in `/flow`, TUI does not crash |

## Phase order

**Phase 1 (UI): PI-01 → PI-02 → PI-04 → PI-05.** (PI-03 dropped by decision 2.)
**Phase 2 (tokens/portability/evaluation): PI-06 → PI-07 → PI-08, plus PI-09 which may run in parallel.**
Phase 2 must not start before PI-04 lands, so token work is never blamed for UI regressions.

## Adoption boundary

PI-09 produces a written recommendation about a compressing proxy. It has no authority to change `models.json`, `settings.json`, or any provider route. If the recommendation is favourable, that is a new planner run with its own decision, its own invariants for a second party seeing full prompts, and its own prompt-cache impact analysis.

## Out of scope (explicit)

CodeGraph and any external structural-retrieval service — not chosen; reopen in a future planner run if wanted. Direct adoption of any proxy — see the adoption boundary above.
