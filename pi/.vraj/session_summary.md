# Session summary — 2026-08-05

## Handoff state

- Repository: `VrajGupta/Pi-Setup`
- Branch/target: `main` / `main`
- Current amendment commit: `ff96fe0d92615a4604412a31a327ef5f4476b26e`
- Takeover context commit and remote `main`: `38a97d5ad64363bf9c290f9898ccb04cd1d23fcf`
- Active ticket: PI-11 / #1, `Agent Ready`
- No active agents. Worktree was clean after the amendment commit.

## Completed

- PI-06/#2, PI-07/#9, PI-08/#10, PI-09/#11, PI-15/#12: `Done`, independently reviewed.
- Global Pi policy updated: minimal tests, bounded execution/output/context hygiene, capability-tier fallbacks, durable handoffs, deadlock/stalemate envelopes, helper cap, bounded review strikes.
- PI-15 rollback docs/manifest implementation passed final review after two bounce repairs.

## Decision and invariants

Vraj explicitly chose **Amend invariant** for PI-11's reviewer bounce-3 finding. Positive sub-1% usage may round to `0%` only in the unconsumed shared formatter `extensions/shared/context-utilization.ts`; this is accepted display precision, not task progress. Zero/invalid/missing readings remain unknown without `%`. Shipped stage rows retain `<1%`. Orchestrator-only input, settings/no-STEER, relay identity, read-only takeover, secret redaction, width/line bounds, and no-new-trust-edge remain hard.

## Durable artifacts

- `docs/2026-08-04-flow-todo-crossrepo-and-docs.md` — amendment and non-goals.
- `tickets.md` — PI-11 `Agent Ready`, bounce history preserved.
- `docs/handoffs/2026-08-05-planner-pi11-amendment.md` — next-harness handoff.
- Issue #1 body — amended acceptance criteria and Project #12 authority.

## Remaining queue

- PI-11 must run coder → debugger → independent reviewer; only reviewer may set `Done`.
- PI-16/#3, PI-13/#4, PI-17/#5 are Planned behind PI-11.
- PI-12/#6 follows PI-16; PI-10/#7 follows PI-12 and PI-13; PI-14/#8 follows PI-10.
- Do not touch the shared formatter residual under PI-11. Keep PI-11's exact verification command from issue #1/tickets.md.

## Next action

Run `git status`, verify local/remote SHA, read this summary and the planner handoff, then start the pinned coder stage for PI-11. Do not claim completion until the independent reviewer passes.
